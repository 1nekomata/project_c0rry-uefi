# c0rry-uefi

## What is this?
A UEFI Bootloader that was born from [project_c0rry](https://github.com/1nekomata/project_c0rry),
as I started to dislike developing a bootloader in BIOS and for now shifted my attention to UEFI.
Also this will probably contain more dumb features than [project_c0rry](https://github.com/1nekomata/project_c0rry).
